# PythonGameWithMusic
Simple Game made in Python with selfmade music.

Rules:
Use Arrowkeys Left and Right do dodge the evil squares and collect the green ones :-)

Maybe to be continued.

You can change the default (non boss) music in the play_music() function.
There is goodVibes and goodVibes-2 to chose from.

Maybe later the music change happens before and after boss phase.
